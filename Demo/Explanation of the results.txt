The results include two folds, /classification_output and /Saliency_output. 
/classification_output contains the results of classification from the testing data (folder /test_dataset) of four datasets using the trained models in the folder /trained model. The results of each dataset included two .csv files. One file included the groud truth and the corresponding output probability of each protein in the test datasets, and the other one included four metrics , the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area uder the ROC curve (AUC).
 /Saliency_output contains the results of the contribution of individual AAs and AA segments. 
 /gradCAM contains the results of the contribution of individual AAs. /FUS_family contains the results of the contribution of individual AAs in FUS proteins. The FUS_acid_avgscore.csv file contains the ranking results of the contribution scores of AAs in FUS proteins, which is related to the Figure 3C of the manuscript. /mydata_1507_data contains the results of the contribution of individual AAs in the in-house dataset. The acid_avgscore.csv file contains the ranking results of the contribution scores of AAs in the in-house dataset, which is related to the Figure 3D of the manuscript. The RCNN_ECA_ptotein_score contains the contribution score of each AA in all the proteins in the in-house dataset. The segment_effect_mydata.csv file contains the results of Figure 3B of the manuscript, in which 'seg_effect' represents the score proportion of different segments of a protein.
Folder /LCRs_process contains the results of the contribution of AA segments in five FUS proteins and five in-house proteins.
/LCRs_process/FUS_family contains the LCRs_proteins_densitymap_train.csv file, in which 'score' represents the contributing score to every individual AA inside the five FUS proteins, and 'process_density' represents the resutls after employing kernel density estimation. This is related to the Figures 5A and 5B. 
/LCRs_process/test contains the LCRs_proteins_densitymap_train.csv file, which is similar to that in the /FUS_family folder. This is related to the Figures 6A and 6B.
